Appendix: Example corpus phonotactics
**********
The example corpus included with PCT is designed to have phonotactic restrictions that can be investigated using the analyses in PCT. Specifically, the corpus is known to have the following phonotactic restrictions:

1. [e] and [o] are allophones of [i] and [u], respectively, which only occur immediately before a nasal consonant.
2. Non-low vowel harmony with blocking nasals: there are no sequences of a non-low front vowel followed (at any distance) by a non-low mid vowel or vice-versa without an intervening nasal consonant.
3. Left-spreading ʃ-dominant sibilant harmony: there are no sequences of [s] followed (at any distance) by [ʃ].
4. Purely CV syllable structure.
