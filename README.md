Introduction
------------
Phonological CorpusTools is a suite of software written in Python designed to help phonologists carry out quantitative analyses of wordlist-format corpora.

CorpusTools can be employed in three different ways:

1. Using the built-in GUI (graphical interface)
2. Using the built-in command-line (terminal) interface
3. Importing parts of CorpusTools as Python modules
