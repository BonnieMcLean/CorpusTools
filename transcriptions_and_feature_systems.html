<p>In order to do phonological analysis, PCT needs to know what segments
exist in a corpus, and what features are assigned to each segment.
There are a variety of built-in transcription systems and feature
systems available, but users can also define their own for custom
use. Transcription and feature systems are essentially packaged
together as .txt files in the form of a spreadsheet, where particular
transcription symbols are mapped to a set of features (described below
in <a class="reference internal" href="#feature-format"><em>Required format of a feature file</em></a>). In general, however, feature systems (i.e., files containing
transcriptions and their features) must be explicitly loaded into PCT
before they are available for use. Thus, it makes sense to start by
loading in at least one such system before attempting to work with corpora.</p>
<div class="section" id="required-format-of-a-feature-file">
<span id="feature-format"></span><h2>Required format of a feature file<a class="headerlink" href="#required-format-of-a-feature-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, transcription and feature systems are packaged
together as .txt files in the form of a delimited spreadsheet. The
first column in the file lists all the transcription symbols that
are to be recognized. <em>Note that this column must be labeled with
the name “symbol” in order for PCT to correctly read in the file</em>.
Every symbol used in the corpus needs to be in this column. Subsequent
columns list individual features that are to be used. Each cell in a
row gives either a + or – for each feature, indicating what value the
initial symbol in that row has for that feature; a 0 or n can also be
used, to indicate that a particular feature is not defined for a given
segment (0 is the default in the built-in <em>hayes</em> system; n is the default
in the built-in <em>spe</em> system). The following shows an example; keep in mind
that this is in fact a tab-delimited .txt file, but the names in the
first row are longer than any of the values in subsequent rows, so the
alignment is visually misleading. For example, the first row containing
symbols contains the symbol [p], which is designated as [-syllabic],
[+consonantal], [-sonorant], [-continuant], etc., although the column
names aren’t aligned with the feature values visually.</p>

<span id="download-features"></span><h2>Downloadable transcription and feature choices<a class="headerlink" href="#downloadable-transcription-and-feature-choices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently, the built-in transcription systems that are recognized are
IPA, ARPABET (used for the <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#cmu" id="id1">[CMU]</a> dictionary), XSAMPA, CELEX, DISC, and
Klatt. These transcription systems can be associated with either the
features as laid out in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#mielke2012" id="id2">[Mielke2012]</a>, which in turn are based on [SPE],
or as laid out in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#hayes2009" id="id3">[Hayes2009]</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id4">[1]</a>. Each of these
transcription-to-feature mappings is laid out as above in a .txt file that
can be downloaded from within PCT. The former system is called “spe” for
short within PCT, while the latter is called “hayes.”</p>
<p>To download one of these systems, click on “Corpus” /
“Manage feature systems...” and follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Download</strong>: Click on “Download feature systems” to open up the relevant dialogue box.</li>
<li><strong>Transcription</strong>: Select which of the transcription systems you want
(IPA, ARPABET, XSAMPA, CELEX, DISC, Klatt).</li>
<li><strong>Feature system</strong>: Select which set of features you would like to map
the transcription symbols to (SPE or Hayes).</li>
<li><strong>Saving</strong>: Click “OK” to have PCT load in the selected feature file
(you must be connected to the internet to have this functionality).
The newly downloaded feature file will now appear in your “Manage
feature systems” dialogue box, and is available for all subsequent
use of PCT unless and until you delete it (done by selecting the
system and clicking “Remove selected feature system”). Click “Done”
to return to the regular corpus analysis window.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>File selection</strong>: Specify the file by entering its directory path or

</ol>
<p><em>Note: For both existing transcription and feature systems, you still

<span id="modifying-feature"></span><h3>Modifying an existing feature system’s text file<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-an-existing-feature-systems-text-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A custom system can be created from scratch, following the format
described in <a class="reference internal" href="#feature-format"><em>Required format of a feature file</em></a>. It is probably easier, however, to create a new
system by modifying an existing system’s file. While this can be done
to a certain extent within PCT itself (see <a class="reference internal" href="#applying-editing-feature"><em>Applying / editing feature systems</em></a>), large-scale changes
are best done in separate text-editing software. To do so, you’ll need
to start with an existing file, which can be obtained in one of two ways:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Through PCT: Download one of the built-in feature systems (<a class="reference internal" href="#download-features"><em>Downloadable transcription and feature choices</em></a>) and
apply it to your corpus (<a class="reference internal" href="#applying-editing-feature"><em>Applying / editing feature systems</em></a>). Then go to “File” / “Export feature
system as text file...” and save the file locally.</li>
<li>Online: You can directly download .txt files with the currently
available feature systems from the <a class="reference external" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/">PCT SourceForge page</a>, under
“Files.” One advantage to this method is that there may be additional
feature files that are created as .txt files and made available online
before they are packaged into the next release of the downloadable software itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have the file, open it in whatever software you prefer (e.g.,
TextEdit, OpenOffice, etc.); it may be easiest to import it into a
spreadsheet reader (e.g., Excel, Calc, etc.) in terms of legibility.
You can then add new symbols to the first column, feature specifications
in the subsequent columns, new feature names, etc., etc. Remember that
the name of the first column must always be “symbol” in order for PCT to
read the file. Save the new file as a CSV or tab-delimited .txt file,
and load it following the instructions in <a class="reference internal" href="#load-custom-feature"><em>Loading a custom feature system</em></a>.</p>

<span id="applying-editing-feature"></span><h2>Applying / editing feature systems<a class="headerlink" href="#applying-editing-feature-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once a feature system has been loaded into PCT (<a class="reference internal" href="#download-features"><em>Downloadable transcription and feature choices</em></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#custom-feature"><em>Using a custom feature system</em></a>), it is
available for use with a corpus. To do so, first load in a corpus (<a class="reference internal" href="loading_corpora.html#loading-corpora"><em>Loading in corpora</em></a>);
if you are using a custom corpus or creating a corpus from text, you can
select the feature system you want to use during the loading. Once a
corpus has been loaded (with or without a feature system), you can edit
the system by clicking on “Features” / “View / change feature system....”
The following options are shown:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>View system</strong>: At the top of the “Edit feature system” dialogue box,
you’ll see the current transcription and feature system being used,
assuming one has been selected. The first column shows the individual
symbols; subsequent columns give the feature specifications for each
symbol. Clicking on the name of any column sorts the entire set by the
values for that feature; clicking again flips the sort order based on
that same column.</li>
<li><strong>Change transcription and feature systems</strong>: If there is no feature system
already specified, or if you would like to change the transcription or
feature system, use the dropdown menus under “Change feature systems” to
select from your currently available systems. If no system is available,
or the system you want to use is not available, go back to <a class="reference internal" href="#download-features"><em>Downloadable transcription and feature choices</em></a> or <a class="reference internal" href="#custom-feature"><em>Using a custom feature system</em></a>
to learn how to load feature systems in to PCT. Be sure to click on “Save
changes to this corpus’s feature system” after selecting a new feature
system in order to actually apply it to the corpus.</li>
<li><strong>Modify the feature system</strong>: You can modify the current feature system
directly within PCT. There are three options. <em>Be sure to click on
“Save changes to this corpus’s feature system” after adding a new
segment or feature, or editing the feature specifications of a segment,
in order to actually apply the changes to the corpus</em>:<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><strong>Add segment</strong>: To add a new segment and its associated feature values
to the current feature system, click on “Add segment.” A new dialogue
box will open up, with a space to input the symbol and dropdown
menus for all of the features expected in the current system.
You can also specify that all features should be set to a particular
value, and then change / edit individual features as needed.
Simply fill in all the values and click “OK”; the symbol and
features will be added to the feature system.</li>
<li><strong>Edit segment</strong>: To change the feature specifications of an existing segment,
click on the row containing that segment and then on “Edit Segment.”
Then use the resulting dialogue box to change the feature specifications.</li>
<li><strong>Add feature</strong>: To add an additional feature to the current system,
click on “Add feature.” Enter the name of the feature in the dialogue
box, select the default value that all segments will have for this
feature, and hit “OK.” The feature will be added to all the segments
in the corpus, with the default value. To change the value of the
feature for each segment, simply click on the segment and then use
the “Edit segment” functionality described above; the new feature
will automatically be added to the dialogue box for each segment.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Corpus inventory coverage</strong>: There are two tools built in to help you
check the coverage in your corpus.<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><strong>Extraneous symbols</strong>: The built-in feature systems are fairly
extensive, and may include symbols for sounds that do not occur
in your corpus. Click on “Hide all segments not used by corpus”
to remove such segments from the viewing window. (This does NOT
remove them from the feature system itself; it just de-clutters
your view of the system.) To revert back to the full system,
simply click on “Show full feature system.”</li>
<li><strong>Corpus coverage</strong>: It’s possible that there are symbols used in
your corpus that are <strong>not</strong> covered in whatever feature system you
have selected. To find out, click on “Check corpus inventory
coverage.” A new window will appear that either confirms that
all symbols in the corpus are mapped onto features, or lists
the symbols that are currently lacking. If there are symbols
that are missing, you’ll need to add them before doing phonological
analysis on the corpus. You can do so in two ways: (1) adding them
within the PCT interface, following the instructions under “Modify
the feature system,” immediately below; or (2) changing the feature
system itself by editing the .txt file and reloading it (more
information given in <a class="reference internal" href="#modifying-feature"><em>Modifying an existing feature system’s text file</em></a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Display options</strong>: The standard view (shown below) is to display the
segments and features as a matrix. One can also select “tree” view,
which allows one to see a list of the segments included in the
transcription system, organized by phonetic characteristics (but
currently without all of their feature specifications).</li>

<div class="section" id="creating-new-tiers-in-the-corpus">
<span id="create-tiers"></span><h2>Creating new tiers in the corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-tiers-in-the-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to have PCT extract a tier of segments from the
transcribed words in your corpus, based on any segment, feature, or
set of features that are defined for your corpus. For example, it is
easy to extract separate tiers for consonants and vowels. This extraction
is particularly useful if, for example, one is interested in looking at
an analysis of predictability of distribution where the conditioning
contexts are non-adjacent segments; the extraction of a tier allows
otherwise non-adjacent segments to be adjacent to each other on the
selected tier. For example, one could examine the possibility of vowel
height harmony in language X by extracting the vowels from all words and
then calculating the extent to which high / low vowels are predictably
distributed in high / low vowel contexts. (See also <a class="reference internal" href="#add-column"><em>Adding a column</em></a> for information
on how to add a column to a corpus, which contains any kind of user-specified
information, and <a class="reference internal" href="#add-count-column"><em>Adding a “count” column</em></a> for information on how to add a count column to a
corpus, which contains counts of specific elements within each entry in the corpus.)</p>
<p>To create a new tier for a corpus that is currently open, click on the
“Corpus” menu and select either “Add tier...” or “Add abstract tier...”;
the “create tier” dialogue box opens. An “abstract” tier is a tier that is
not based directly on the transcriptins themselves, but rather abstracts
to a higher level. As of January 2015, the only abstract tier available is
a CV skeleton tier. Before creating the tier, you can “preview” the tier
as in the following example; this shows what segments PCT thinks are
consonants and vowels in the current corpus.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/cvtier.png"><img alt="_images/cvtier.png" class="align-center" src="_images/cvtier.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>The example corpus after an abstract CV tier has been added:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/examplecvtier.png"><img alt="_images/examplecvtier.png" class="align-center" src="_images/examplecvtier.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>To create a less abstract tier, i.e., one that is just an extraction of
all transcription symbols in the corpus that have some particular feature
value, use the following instructions after choosing “Corpus” / “Add tier...”:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Enter a short-hand name for the tier, which will appear as the
column header in your corpus. For example, “vowels” or “consonants” or “nasals.”</li>
<li><strong>Basis for creating tier</strong>: You can create the tier using natural classes
if you base the tier on features; you can also create “unnatural” tiers
that are simply extractions of any set of user-defined segments.</li>
<li><strong>Segments</strong>: If creating the tier on segments, you’ll see all the segments
in your corpus in a preview window arranged roughly along the lines of a
standard IPA chart. Select as many of these as you want. The image below
shows an example of creating a tier to contain all the non-mid vowels in
the example corpus:</li>
</ol>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/createtier.png"><img alt="_images/createtier.png" class="align-center" src="_images/createtier.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="4">
<li><strong>Features</strong>: If you’re creating the tier based on features, you’ll see
the list of all available features in your corpus on the left. Select a
feature that will be used to define the tier. To define the tier based
on positive values for that feature, select “Add [+feature].” To define
the tier based on negative values, select “Add [-feature].” For example,
to define a vowel tier, one might select the [voc] feature from the SPE
feature set, and then add positive values, as shown below. The selected
feature will appear in the right-hand menu. To add additional features,
repeat this step. For example, one could define a sibilant tier in the
SPE system by selecting [+cor] and [+strid]. The features available will
be based on whatever feature system has been selected as part of the
corpus; see <a class="reference internal" href="#download-features"><em>Downloadable transcription and feature choices</em></a> for information on selecting or defining different
features for the segments in the corpus.</li>

<li>Preview: To see which segments the currently selected feature values
will extract, select “Preview tier.” This will show both the set of
segments included by the selected feature values, as well as the
segments that are excluded (to help verify that the selection is as
expected). A vowel tier based on [+voc] in the example corpus is
previewed below:</li>
</ol>

<li>Removing a feature: To remove a selected feature, click on that
feature in the “Selected features” menu and then choose “Remove feature.”</li>
<li>Finalizing the tier: To create the tier and return to the corpus,
click on “Create tier.” It may take a moment to process the entire
corpus, but a new column should be added to the corpus that shows the
segments matching these feature selections for every word in the corpus.</li>
<li>Saving the tier: The tier can be saved along with the corpus for future
use by selecting “Corpus” / “Save corpus” from the menu items (this will
be done automatically if auto-save is on; see <a class="reference internal" href="loading_corpora.html#preferences"><em>Preferences</em></a>). It is also possible
to export the corpus as a text file (.txt), which can be opened in other
software, by selecting “File” / “Export corpus as text file.”</li>
<li>Removing a tier: To delete a tier that has been created, simply click on
“Corpus” / “Remove tier or column...” and select the tier you want to
remove; then click “Remove.” You can also right-click on the column name
and select “Remove column.” Note that only tiers that have been added
through PCT can be removed; tiers that are inherent in loaded corpora
cannot be removed in PCT. You can, of course, export the corpus
itself to a text file, remove the column manually, and then re-load
the changed corpus. To remove all the added tiers, leaving only the
inherent (“essential”) tiers in the corpus, select “Remove all non-essential
columns.” PCT will list which columns are non-essential and verify that
you want to remove them before the removal is permanent. The “essential”
columns for most corpora are “Spelling,” “Transcription,” and “Frequency.”</li>

column will have numeric values, upon with mathematical operations
can be performed. A factor column will have values that can contain
characters or numbers, but are limited in number, as in the levels

information (<a class="reference internal" href="#add-column"><em>Adding a column</em></a>), and tiers that contain phonological information
based on the entries themselves (<a class="reference internal" href="#create-tiers"><em>Creating new tiers in the corpus</em></a>), one can also add “Count”
columns, which contain information about the <em>number</em> of occurrences of
a feature or segment in each entry in a corpus. For example, one could
add a column that lists, for each entry, the number of round vowels
that are contained in that entry. To add a count column, go to “Corpus”
/ “Add count column...” and then do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Enter the name of the new column.</li>
<li><strong>Tier</strong>: Specify what tier the count column should refer to in order to
determine the counts (e.g., transcription or a derived tier such as
a vowel tier).</li>
<li><strong>Segment selection</strong>: Choose to count things based on either segments or
features. If segments are counted, select the segment or segments from
the inventory (click on “Consonants” and / or “Vowels” to reveal which
segments are available in the inventory). If features are selected,
click on each feature and then the value of that feature that should be used.</li>
</ol>
<p>Click “Add count column” to return to the corpus and see the new column,
with its count values automatically filled in.</p>

<span id="remove-column"></span><h3>Removing a tier or column<a class="headerlink" href="#removing-a-tier-or-column" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To delete a tier or column that has been created, simply click on
“Corpus” / “Remove tier or column...” and select the tier you want to
remove; then click “Remove.” Note that only tiers that have been added
through PCT can be removed; tiers that are inherent in loaded corpora
cannot be removed in PCT. You can, of course, export the corpus itself
to a text file, remove the column manually, and then re-load the changed
corpus. To remove all the added tiers, leaving only the inherent
(“essential”) tiers in the corpus, select “Remove all non-essential
columns.” PCT will list which columns are non-essential and verify that
you want to remove them before the removal is permanent. The “essential”
columns for most corpora are “Spelling,” “Transcription,” and “Frequency.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-a-word">
<span id="add-word"></span><h3>Adding a word<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-word" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a general proposition, we don’t recommend using PCT as a database
manager. It is designed to facilitate analyses of pre-existing corpora
rather than to be an interface for creating corpora. That said, it is
occasionally useful to be able to add a word to a pre-existing corpus in
PCT. Note that this function will actually add the word to the corpus
(and, if auto-save is on, the word will be saved automatically in future
iterations of the corpus). If you simply need to add a word temporarily,
e.g., to calculate the neighbourhood density of a hypothetical word given
the current corpus, you can also add a word in the relevant function’s
dialogue box, without adding the word permanently to the corpus.</p>
<p>To do add the word globally, howveer, go to “Corpus” / “Add new word...”
and do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Spelling</strong>: Type in the orthographic representation of the new word.</li>
<li><strong>Transcription</strong>: To add in the phonetic transcription of the new word,
it is best to use the provided inventory. While it is possible to type
directly in to the transcription box, using the provided inventory will
ensure that all characters are understood by PCT to correspond to existing
characters in the corpus (with their concomitant featural interpretation).
Click on “Show inventory” and then choose to show “Consonants,” “Vowels,”
and/or other. (If there is no featural interpretation of your inventory,
you will simply see a list of all the available segments, but they will
not be classifed by major category.) Clicking on the individual segments
will add them to the transcription. The selections will remain even
when the sub-inventories are hidden; we allow for showing / hiding
the inventories to ensure that all relevant buttons on the dialogue
box are available, even on small computer screens. Note that you do
NOT need to include word boundaries at the beginning and end of the
word, even when the boundary symbol is included as a member of the
inventory; these will be assumed automatically by PCT.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: Enter the token frequency of this word.</li>
<li><strong>Other</strong>: If there are other tiers or columns in your corpus, you can
also enter the relevant values for those columns in the dialogue box.
For tiers that are defined via features, the values should be
automatically populated as you enter the transcription. E.g., if you
have a vowel tier, and add the word [pim.ku] to your corpus by selecting
the relevant segments from the inventory, the vowel tier should
automatically fill in the entry as [i.u].</li>
</ol>
<p>Once all values are filled in, select “Create word” to return to the
corpus with the word added. If auto-save is not on, you can save this
new version of the corpus for future use by going to “File” / “Save corpus.”
If you have added a word and the corpus has NOT been saved (either manually
or through Auto-save) afterward, and then try to quit PCT, it will warn
you that you have unsaved changes and ask that you verify that you want
to quit without saving them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="removing-a-word">
<span id="remove-word"></span><h3>Removing a word<a class="headerlink" href="#removing-a-word" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To remove a word from the corpus, select it in the corpus view and
right-click (ctrl-click on a Mac) on it. Choose “Remove word” from the
menu. Regardless of whether warnings are turned on or not (see <a class="reference internal" href="loading_corpora.html#warnings"><em>Help and warnings</em></a>),
PCT will verify that you want to remove the word before commiting the
change. Word removal is not auto-saved with a corpus, even if “Auto-save”
is turned on (see <a class="reference internal" href="loading_corpora.html#preferences"><em>Preferences</em></a>); if you want to save the new version of the
corpus with the word removed, you should explicitly go to “File” /
“Save corpus.” If you have removed a word and NOT manually saved the
corpus afterward, and then try to quit PCT, it will again warn you that
you have unsaved changes and ask that you verify that you want to quit.</p>

<div class="section" id="editing-a-word">
<span id="edit-word"></span><h3>Editing a word<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-a-word" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To edit a word in the corpus, right-click on the word’s entry and chooser
“Edit word details,” or double-click the word’s entry in the corpus.
A dialogue box opens that shows the word’s spelling, transcription,
frequency, and any other information that is included in the corpus.
Most of these entries can be edited manually, though a few, such as
tiers that are dependent on a word’s transcription, cannot themselves
be directly edited. To edit such a derived tier, edit the transcription
of the word; the derived tier will update automatically as the new
transcription is provided.</p>

<span id="non-transcribed"></span><h3>Hiding / showing non-transcribed items<a class="headerlink" href="#hiding-showing-non-transcribed-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When working with a corpus, it is possible to hide all entries that do
not have a transcription (if any such entries exist). To do this,
right-click anywhere in the corpus itself and select “Hide non-transcribed

<div class="section" id="phonological-search">
<span id="id5"></span><h2>Phonological Search<a class="headerlink" href="#phonological-search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PCT allows you to do searches for various strings, defined by segments or
features. The search returns two types of information: one, a general count
of the number of entries that fit the search description, and two, the
actual list of all the words in the corpus that contain the specified
string. To conduct a search, choose “Corpus” / “Phonological search...”
and do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Basis for search</strong>: Select either segments or features to search for.</li>
<li><strong>Segment-based search selection</strong>: If segments are chosen as the basis of
the search, you will see the segmental inventory of your corpus. Select
a segment that you want to search for.</li>
<li><strong>Feature-based search selection</strong>: If features are chosen as the basis of
the search, you will see the features associated with your corpus.
Select the feature and then the value of that feature that you want
to search for; it will automatically be added to the list. Multiple
features can be selected (e.g., [-voice, -continuant] if one wants to
search for voiceless stops).</li>
<li><strong>Environments</strong>: Click on “Environments” to add one or more environments
that you want to search for that contain the specified segment. Both
the left- and right-hand side of the environment can be specified,
and each can be specified using either segments (automatically populated
by your corpus’ inventory) or features (automatically populated by the
feature system associated with the corpus). After selecting an environment
by clicking on the relevant segments or features, click on “Add” if it
is the last environment you want to add, or “Add and create another”
if you want to add additional environments.</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of adding environments (in this case, the environment “word-initial,
before a vowel”):</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/phonosearchenvironment.png"><img alt="_images/phonosearchenvironment.png" class="align-center" src="_images/phonosearchenvironment.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Tier: Select the tier on which phonological search should be performed.
The default would be the transcription tier, so that phonological
environments are defined locally. But, for example, if a vowel tier
is selected, then one could search for the occurrence of, e.g., [i]
before mid vowels on that tier (hence ignoring intervening consonants).</li>
</ol>
<p>An example of the phonological search window, set up to search for
voiceless stops word-initially before vowels and between [a] vowels,
on the transcription tier:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/phonosearchenvironment2.png"><img alt="_images/phonosearchenvironment2.png" class="align-center" src="_images/phonosearchenvironment2.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>6. Results: Once all selections have been made, click on “Calculate
phonological search.” If there is not already an existing results table,
or you want to start a new once, choose the “Start new results table”
option. If you want to add the results to a pre-existing table, choose
the “Add to current results table” option. The results appear in a new
dialogue box that first shows the summary results, i.e., a list that
contains the segment that was searched for, each environment that was
searched for, the total count of words that contain that segment in that
environment, and the total token frequency for those words (note that
these are the frequencies of the WORDS containing the specified environments,
so if for example, a particular word contains multiple instances of the same
environment, this is NOT reflected in the counts). The individual words in
the corpus that match the search criteria can be shown by clicking on “Show
individual results” at the bottom of the screen; this opens a new dialogue
box in which each word in the corpus that matches the search criteria is
listed, including the transcription of the word, the segment that was found
that matches the search criteria, and which environment that segment
occurred in in that word. Note that the results can be sorted by any of
the columns by clicking on that column’s name (e.g., to get all the words
that contained the [a_a] environment together, simply click on the “Environment”
label at the top of that column). To return to the summary results, click on
“Show summary results.” Each set of results can be saved to a .txt file by
clicking “Save to file” at the bottom of the relevant results window. To
return to the search selection dialogue box, click on “Reopen function dialogue.”
Otherwise, when finished, click on “Close window” to return to the corpus.</p>

English diphthongs using two additional features, [diphthong] and
[front-diphthong]. The former has a [+] value for all diphthongs, a
[-] value for all vowels that are not diphthongs, and a [0] value for
non-vowels. The latter references the end point of a diphthong; [aɪ],
[eɪ], and [ɔɪ] are [+front-diphthong], [aʊ] and [oʊ] are [-front-diphthong].
All other segments are left unspecified for this feature. Other vowel
features for diphthongs are specified based on the first element of
the diphthong; e.g., all of [aɪ], [eɪ], [ɔɪ], [aʊ], and [oʊ] are
