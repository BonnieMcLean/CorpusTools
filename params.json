{"name":"Phonological CorpusTools","tagline":"Take the stress out of corpus analysis!","body":"Phonological CorpusTools\r\n========================\r\n\r\n## About Phonological CorpusTools\r\n\r\nThere is an ever-increasing interest in exploring the roles of frequency and usage in understanding phonological phenomena (e.g., Bybee 2001, Ernestus 2011, Frisch 2011, Archangeli & Pulleyblank 2013, Hume et al. to appear). Corpora of language give us a way of making generalizations across wide swaths of such usage, but:\r\n* many corpora and analysis tools are focused on dialogue- and sentence-level analysis, rather than phonological analysis;\r\n* the skills needed to efficiently handle large corpora can be daunting to learn; and\r\n* researchers may be using different instantiations of the “same” formulae, making direct comparisons of phenomena difficult.\r\n\r\nPhonological CorpusTools (PCT) is our answer to these problems -- a downloadable program with both a graphical and command-line interface, designed to be an analysis aid for dealing with questions of phonological interest in large corpora. \r\n\r\n### What do we mean by a \"corpus\"?\r\n\r\nWithin PCT, a corpus refers to a structured list of words, each phonologically transcribed, and accompanied by their token frequency of occurrence within some body of usage. It can contain other information as well – e.g., lexical class of the word, number of syllables, morphological parse, etc. – but it doesn’t have to. PCT can also be used to convert running text into a frequency-tagged corpus of this sort.\r\n\r\n### Functionality\r\n\r\n* **Featural interpretation**: Ability to analyse a transcribed corpus with any set of phonological features; both the transcription system and the feature set may be one of the ones built-in (Hayes 2008; Mielke 2008) or may be user-defined. Phonological tiers may be extracted based on features.\r\n* **Functional load**: Calculation of the functional load of individual pairs of sounds within the corpus, defined at either the segment or feature level (cf. Hockett 1966; Surendran & Niyogi 2003; Wedel, Kaplan, & Jackson 2013).\r\n* **Predictability of distribution**: Calculation of the extent to which any pair of sounds is predictably distributed, given a set of environments that they can occur in (cf. Hall 2009, 2012; Hall & Hall 2013).\r\n* **String similarity**: Calculation of the extent to which pairs of words are similar to each other using either orthographic or phonetic transcription (e.g., for calculating neighbourhood density) (cf. Frisch et al. 2004, Khorsi 2012; Greenberg & Jenkins 1964; Luce & Pisoni 1998; Yao 2011).\r\n* **Frequency of alternation**: Estimation of the frequency with which two sounds alternate with each other, given a measure of similarity (cf. Silverman 2006, Johnson & Babel 2010, Lu 2012).\r\n* **Acoustic similarity**: Calculation of the acoustic similarity between sounds / words, based on alignment of MFCCs (cf. Mielke 2012) or amplitude envelopes (cf. Lewandowski 2012), derived from .wav files.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nPlease see the user's manual for complete documentation.\r\n\r\n## Standard installation (executable)\r\n\r\nNOTE: The acoustic similarity module in Phonological CorpusTools currently only works if you have intalled PCT using the fallback installation (setup.py) instructions below.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n(NOTE: This method requires that you are running a 64-bit version of windows. You can check this by in Control Panel -> System and Security -> System.)\r\n\r\nDownload the file 'corpustools-0.15-amd64.msi' from the Phonological CorpusTools page on SourceForge. It can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/win64/Phonological%20CorpusTools-0.15-amd64.msi/download . Double-click this file to install PCT to your computer. It can then be run the same as any other program, via Start -> Programs.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS X\r\n\r\nDownload the file 'pct.zip' from the Phonological CorpusTools page on SourceForge. It can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/macosx/pct.zip/download . Unzip this file to access 'pct.app' (most likely by double-clicking it). You can then double-click this file to run Phonological CorpusTools. You can move the icon to your toolbar like any other application. \r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nThere is currently no executable option available for Linux operating systems. Please use the fallback installation method below to install from source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fallback installation (setup.py)\r\n\r\n### Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n- Python 3.3 or higher: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/\r\n- Setuptools: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\r\n- Tk: http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/\r\n\r\nIf you expect to use the acoustic similarity module, there are additional dependencies:\r\n- NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/\r\n- SciPy: http://www.scipy.org/\r\n(If you are on Windows and can't successfully use the acoustic similarity module after installing from the above sources, you may want to try installing from the precompiled binaries here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ .)\r\n\r\nDownload the source code for Phonological CorpusTools here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/corpustools-0.15.zip/download . (If you prefer, you can find a tarball here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/corpustools-0.15.tar.gz/download) After expanding the file, you will find a file called 'setup.py' in the top level directory. Run it in *one* of the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. Double-click it. If this doesn't work, access the file properties and ensure that you have permission to run the file; if not, give them to yourself. In Windows, this may require that you open the file in Administrator mode (also accessible through file properties). If your computer opens the .py file in a text editor rather than running it, you can access the file properties to set Python 3.x as the default program to use with run .py files. If the file is opened in IDLE (a Python editor), you can use the \"Run\" button in the IDLE interface to run the script instead.\r\n\r\n2. Open a terminal window and run the file. In Linux or Mac OS X, there should be a Terminal application pre-installed. In Windows, you may need to install Cygwin ( https://www.cygwin.com/ ). Once the terminal window is open, nagivate to the top level CorpusTools folder---the one that has setup.py in it. (Use the command 'cd' to navigate your filesystem; Google \"terminal change directory\" for further instructions.) Once in the correct directory, run this command: \"python3 setup.py install\" (no quotes). You may lack proper permissions to run this file, in which case on Linux or Mac OS X you can instead run \"sudo python3 setup.py install\". If Python 3.x is the only version of Python on your system, it may be possible or necessary to use the command \"python\" rather than \"python3\".\r\n\r\nPhonological CorpusTools should now be installed! Run it from a terminal window using the command \"pct\". You can also open a \"Run\" dialogue and use the command \"pct\" there. In Windows, the Run tool is usuall found in All Programs -> Accessories.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n* Archangeli, Diana & Douglas Pulleyblank. 2013. The role of UG in phonology.
