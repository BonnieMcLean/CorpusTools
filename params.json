{"name":"Phonological CorpusTools","tagline":"Take the stress out of corpus analysis!","body":"Phonological CorpusTools\r\n========================\r\n\r\nThis document contains installation instructions for Phonological CorpusTools (PCT). For a description of available functionality, please refer to the manual included alongside this file.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The acoustic similarity module in Phonological CorpusTools currently only works if you have intalled PCT using the fallback installation (setup.py) instructions below.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Standard installation (executable)\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\n(NOTE: This method requires that you are running a 64-bit version of windows. You can check this by in Control Panel -> System and Security -> System.)\r\n\r\nDownload the file 'corpustools-0.15-amd64.msi' from the Phonological CorpusTools page on SourceForge. It can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/win64/Phonological%20CorpusTools-0.15-amd64.msi/download . Double-click this file to install PCT to your computer. It can then be run the same as any other program, via Start -> Programs.\r\n\r\n### Mac OS X\r\n\r\nDownload the file 'pct.zip' from the Phonological CorpusTools page on SourceForge. It can be found here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/macosx/pct.zip/download . Unzip this file to access 'pct.app' (most likely by double-clicking it). You can then double-click this file to run Phonological CorpusTools. You can move the icon to your toolbar like any other application. \r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nThere is currently no executable option available for Linux operating systems. Please use the fallback installation method below to install from source.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fallback installation (setup.py)\r\n\r\n### Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux\r\n\r\nDependencies:\r\n- Python 3.3 or higher: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/\r\n- Setuptools: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools\r\n- Tk: http://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/\r\n\r\nIf you expect to use the acoustic similarity module, there are additional dependencies:\r\n- NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/\r\n- SciPy: http://www.scipy.org/\r\n(If you are on Windows and can't successfully use the acoustic similarity module after installing from the above sources, you may want to try installing from the precompiled binaries here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/ .)\r\n\r\nDownload the source code for Phonological CorpusTools here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/corpustools-0.15.zip/download . (If you prefer, you can find a tarball here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/phonologicalcorpustools/files/0.15/corpustools-0.15.tar.gz/download) After expanding the file, you will find a file called 'setup.py' in the top level directory. Run it in *one* of the following ways:\r\n\r\n1. Double-click it. If this doesn't work, access the file properties and ensure that you have permission to run the file; if not, give them to yourself. In Windows, this may require that you open the file in Administrator mode (also accessible through file properties). If your computer opens the .py file in a text editor rather than running it, you can access the file properties to set Python 3.x as the default program to use with run .py files. If the file is opened in IDLE (a Python editor), you can use the \"Run\" button in the IDLE interface to run the script instead.\r\n\r\n2. Open a terminal window and run the file. In Linux or Mac OS X, there should be a Terminal application pre-installed. In Windows, you may need to install Cygwin ( https://www.cygwin.com/ ). Once the terminal window is open, nagivate to the top level CorpusTools folder---the one that has setup.py in it. (Use the command 'cd' to navigate your filesystem; Google \"terminal change directory\" for further instructions.) Once in the correct directory, run this command: \"python3 setup.py install\" (no quotes). You may lack proper permissions to run this file, in which case on Linux or Mac OS X you can instead run \"sudo python3 setup.py install\". If Python 3.x is the only version of Python on your system, it may be possible or necessary to use the command \"python\" rather than \"python3\".\r\n\r\nPhonological CorpusTools should now be installed! Run it from a terminal window using the command \"pct\". You can also open a \"Run\" dialogue and use the command \"pct\" there. In Windows, the Run tool is usuall found in All Programs -> Accessories.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
