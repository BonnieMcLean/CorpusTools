<span id="loading-corpora"></span><h1>Loading in corpora<a class="headerlink" href="#loading-in-corpora" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In order to use the analysis functions in PCT, you’ll first need to open
up a corpus. There are four possible ways of doing this: first, you can
use a built-in corpus (a small, entirely invented sample corpus or the
Irvine Phonotactic Online Dictionary of English <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#iphod" id="id1">[IPHOD]</a>;
second, you can use a corpus that is independently stored on your local
computer; third, you can create a new corpus from text; and fourth, you can
import a spontaneous speech corpus (e.g. from Praat TextGrids or from your
own local copy of a corpus such as the Buckeye corpus <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#buckeye" id="id2">[BUCKEYE]</a>
or TIMIT corpus <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#timit" id="id3">[TIMIT]</a>. Each of these will be discussed
in turn. The basic structure of a corpus, however, is a list of words
with other possible information about each: e.g., its transcription,
its frequency of occurrence, its lexical category, its syllable structure,
etc. These are in columnar format; e.g., loaded from a CSV or
tab-delimited text file.</p>
<div class="section" id="using-a-built-in-corpus">
<span id="download-corpora"></span><h2>Using a built-in corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-built-in-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To use a built-in corpus, simply go to the “Corpus” menu and select
“Load corpus...” from the list, which will open the “Load corpus” dialogue box.</p>
<p>The first time you want to use a built-in corpus, you’ll need to download it
(from a Dropbox link accessed by PCT internally); you must therefore be
connected to the internet to complete this step. To do so, click on
“Download example corpora” from the right-hand menu. This will allow
you to download either the Example corpus and/or the IPHOD corpus
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#iphod" id="id4">[IPHOD]</a>. Note that the version of the IPHOD corpus that is
contained here has been altered from the freely <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iphod.com/">downloadable version</a>, in that it (1) does not have the derived columns and
(2) has been re-formatted as a .corpus file for easy reading by PCT.
It also contains only the following information: word, transcription,
and token frequency (from the SUBTLEX corpus <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#subtlex" id="id5">[SUBTLEX]</a>).
Please note that if you use the IPHOD corpus, you should use the following
citation (see more on citing corpora and functions of PCT in <a class="reference internal" href="citing_pct.html#citing-pct"><em>Citing PCT and the algorithms used therein</em></a>):</p>
<p>Vaden, K. I., Halpin, H. R., Hickok, G. S. (2009). Irvine Phonotactic Online
Dictionary, Version 2.0. [Data file]. Available from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.iphod.com/">http://www.iphod.com/</a>.</p>
<p>After the corpus has been downloaded, it appears in the lefthand side of
the “Load Corpus” dialogue box. Simply select the corpus and click on
“Load selected corpus” at the bottom of the dialogue box. Once these
corpora have been downloaded once, you don’t have to do so again; they
will be saved automatically to your local system unless and until you
delete them. On subsequent loadings of the PCT software, you will still
see these corpora listed in the lefthand side of the “Load Corpus” dialogue
box, as in the following diagram:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="images/loadcorpus.png"><img alt="images/loadcorpus.png" class="align-center" src="images/loadcorpus.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>The example corpus and the included version of the IPHOD corpus include
phonetic transcriptions in IPA, and are by default interpreted either
using the feature system of <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#mielke2012" id="id6">[Mielke2012]</a>, which in turn is based on
SPE features <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#spe" id="id7">[SPE]</a> [this is the default for the example corpus], or using
the feature system suggested by <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#hayes2009" id="id8">[Hayes2009]</a> [this is the default
for the IPHOD corpus]. These systems are fully functional for doing subsequent
analyses. Note, however, that this is a built-in functionality of these
particular corpora, and does not allow you to use SPE or Hayes features
with other corpora. To use SPE features with other corpora, or to change
the feature system associated with a built-in corpus, you’ll need to
download the actual feature files, as described in
<a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#transcriptions-and-feature-systems"><em>Working with transcriptions and feature systems</em></a>. Features can be used
for defining classes of sounds (e.g., creating separate tiers for
different types of segments) and for defining environments (e.g., the
environments in which segments might occur, for use in calculating their
predictability of distribution).</p>
<p>The corpus may take several seconds to load, but will eventually appear;
the following is the example corpus:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="images/loadexample.png"><img alt="images/loadexample.png" class="align-center" src="images/loadexample.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>Note that the name of the corpus and the current feature system are shown
at the bottom right-hand corner of the screen for easy reference. <a class="reference internal" href="#corpus-summary"><em>Summary information about a corpus</em></a>
gives more detail on how to find out summary information about your
corpus. Typing a word or part-word in the “search” box takes you to each
successive occurrence of that word in the corpus (hit “return” once to see
the first instance; hit “return” again to see the second, etc.). Note that the
“search” box searches only the “Spelling” column of the corpus. To do a
phonological search, please use the “Phonological search” function under
the “Corpus” menu (see detailed discussion in <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#phonological-search"><em>Phonological Search</em></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-a-custom-corpus">
<span id="custom-corpus"></span><h2>Using a custom corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#using-a-custom-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is also possible to use a custom corpus, i.e., any corpus that is in
the appropriate format (see <a class="reference internal" href="#corpus-format"><em>Required format of corpus</em></a>) and stored independently on your
computer. Before doing so, it may be helpful to first load the appropriate
feature system into PCT, so that the transcriptions in your corpus can be
interpreted; detailed instructions for doing this are given in <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#transcriptions-and-feature-systems"><em>Working with transcriptions and feature systems</em></a>. It is also
possible to load the feature system after you’ve loaded the corpus.</p>
<p>To use a custom corpus, click on “Corpus” / “Load corpus...” and then
choose “Load corpus from pre-formatted text file.” Then, enter the path
for the corpus or select it using “Choose file...” and navigating to it
from a system dialogue box. Enter a name for the corpus and indicate what
the delimiter type is; the default is a comma (,); enter <cite>t</cite>
if the file is tab-delimited. Any symbol can be used; PCT will simply break
elements at that symbol, so whatever symbol is used should be used only to
delimit columns within the corpus. Finally, if there is a column in the corpus
that shows phonetic transcription, choose which feature system you would like
to use. As noted above, in order for there to be feature systems to choose from,
you must first have loaded them into PCT (<a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#transcriptions-and-feature-systems"><em>Working with transcriptions and feature systems</em></a>).</p>
<p>Clicking “OK” in the “Load new corpus” dialogue box returns you to the
“Load corpus” dialogue box, and you will see that the new corpus has been
added to your list of available corpora. Select this new corpus and choose
“Load selected corpus” to open it in PCT.</p>
<div class="section" id="required-format-of-corpus">
<span id="corpus-format"></span><h3>Required format of corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#required-format-of-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to use your own corpus, it must have certain properties.
First, it should be some plain text file (e.g., .txt, .csv); it cannot,
for example, be a .doc or .pdf file. The file should be set up in columns
(e.g., imported from a spreadsheet) and be delimited with some uniform character
(tab, comma, backslash, etc.). The names of most columns of information
can be anything you like, but the column representing common spelling of
the word should be called “spelling”; that with transcription should be
called “transcription”; and that with token frequency should be called
“frequency.” All algorithms for doing corpus analysis will assume these
column names. If, for example, you were using a corpus that had different
frequency columns for total frequency vs. the frequency of occurrence of
the word in its lowercase form (cf. the SUBTLEX corpus), then whichever
column is to be used for token frequency calculations should simply be
labelled “frequency.”</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-a-corpus-from-running-text">
<span id="running-text"></span><h2>Creating a corpus from running text<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-corpus-from-running-text" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is also possible to have PCT create a corpus for you from running text,
either in orthographic or transcribed form. If the text is orthographic,
of course, then segmental / phonological analysis won’t be possible, but
if the text is itself transcribed, then all subsequent analysis functions
are available.1 As with pre-existing corpora, it may be helpful to first
load the relevant feature system into PCT, so that the transcriptions in
your text can be interpreted; detailed instructions for doing this are given
in <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#transcriptions-and-feature-systems"><em>Working with transcriptions and feature systems</em></a> (note that the corpus can be loaded in without featural interpretation,
and features added later).</p>
<p>To create a corpus from text, click on “Corpus” / “Load corpus...” and
then select either “Create corpus from running text (orthography)” or
“Create corpus from running text (transcription).”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>File selection</strong>: Select the name of the plain .txt file by entering the
path directly or choosing the file using a system dialogue box,
by clicking on “Choose file....”</li>
<li><strong>Name of corpus</strong>: Indicate what the name of the corpus should be; PCT
will default to the name of the original .txt file.</li>
<li><strong>Word delimiter</strong>: Enter the character used to delimit words in the
corpus (e.g., a space).</li>
<li><strong>Punctuation</strong>: If there is punctuation in the text, indicate which
elements should be ignored. Ignoring punctuation allows PCT to
compile an accurate count of unique words; for example, the words
“example” and “example,” should be treated as two tokens of the same
word, ignoring the comma at the end of the second one. Punctuation
can be included, however; this might be desirable in a case where a
punctuation symbol is being used within the transcription system
(e.g., [!] used for a retroflex click).</li>
<li><strong>Corpus for transcriptions</strong>: If the corpus is an orthographic one, but
you have a separate corpus that includes both orthographic and trancribed
representations of the words, you can have PCT automatically look up all
of the transcribed words in the separate corpus (e.g., you’re uploading a
new transcribed corpus of English, but want to look up the transcriptions
in IPHOD). Select the other corpus from the dropdown menu; if you haven’t
loaded the corpus into PCT already, this option is not available. Indicate
using the check box whether case (capitalization) should be ignored (e.g.,
if your corpus contains the name “Bud,” PCT will look for an exact
match, “Bud,” unless case is ignored, in which case, the common noun
“bud” will be accepted as a pronunciation source).</li>
<li><strong>Transcription and feature selection</strong>: If the corpus is a transcribed one,
you can select the transcription and featural system, if these systems
have already been loaded into PCT (see also discussion in <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#transcriptions-and-feature-systems"><em>Working with transcriptions and feature systems</em></a>). You can
also indicate what the delimiter is for units of transcription (if
there is such a delimiter). See the note below for details.</li>
<li><strong>A note about complex transcriptions</strong>: There is no way for PCT to know
automatically when a single sound is represented by a sequence of
multiple characters – e.g., that the digraphs [aɪ], [th], [xw], [p’],
[tʃ], and [iː] are intended to represent single sounds rather than
sequences of two sounds. There are currently three possible ways of
ensuring that characters are interpreted correctly:<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><strong>One-to-one transcriptions</strong>: The first way is to use a transcription
system with a one-to-one correspondence between sounds and symbols,
such as DISC. If you need to create a novel transcription system in
order to accomplish this (e.g., using [A] to represent [aɪ] and [2]
to represent [th], etc.), you may certainly do so; it is then necessary
to create a novel feature file so that PCT can interpret your symbols
using known features. See detailed instructions on how to do this in
<a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#download-features"><em>Downloadable transcription and feature choices</em></a>. The word tide in American English might then be transcribed as
[2Ad]. This is a relatively easy solution to implement by using
find-and-replace in a text editing software, though it does result
in less easily human-readable transcriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Delimited transcriptions</strong>: The second way is to use a standard
transcription system, such as IPA, but to delimit every unitary
sound with a consistent mark that is not otherwise used in the
transcription system (e.g., a period). Thus the word <em>tide</em> in
American English might be transcribed in IPA as [.th.aɪ.d.], with
periods around every sound that is to be treated as a single unit.
When creating the corpus, PCT will give you the option of specifying
what the character is. PCT will then read in all elements between
delimiting characters as members of a single “segment” object, which
can be looked up in a standard feature file (either an included one
or a user-defined one; see <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#custom-feature"><em>Using a custom feature system</em></a>). This solution makes it easy to
read transcribed words, but can be more labour-intensive to implement
without knowledge of more sophisticated searching options (e.g.,
using regular expressions or other text manipulation coding) to
automatically insert delimiters in the appropriate places given a
list of complex segments. A first pass can be done using, e.g.,
commands to find “aɪ” and replace it with “.aɪ.” – but delimiters
will also have to be added between the remaining single characters,
without interrupting the digraphs.</li>
<li><strong>Constructed digraphs</strong>: The third option is to tell PCT what the set of
digraphs is in your corpus manually, and then to have PCT automatically
identify these when it creates the corpus. In the “Create corpus from
running text (transcription)” dialogue box, there is an option to
“Construct a digraph.” Once you have entered the path name of the
file you are creating the corpus from, PCT will scan it for single
characters and present these to you as options for constructing digraphs
from. For example, in the following box, all of the single characters
in a Gitksan text file are presented, and can be selected sequentially
to create the appropriate digraphs. This method is somewhat more
labour-intensive in terms of knowing ahead of time what all the
digraphs are and being able to list them, but ensures that all
such occurrences are found in the text file. Note, however, that
if there’s a <em>distinction</em> to be made between a sequence of characters
and a digraph (e.g., [tʃ] as a sequence in <em>great ship</em> vs. as an
affricate in <em>grey chip</em>), this method will be unable to make that
distinction; all instances will be treated as digraphs.</li>

<ol class="arabic simple" start="8">
<li><strong>Create corpus</strong>: Once the options have been selected, click on
“Create corpus.” The columns created are: individual lexical items
(words), their raw token frequency in the corpus, and their relative
token frequency (raw token frequency / total tokens in the corpus).</li>
<li><strong>Use the corpus</strong>: Once the corpus has been created, it also now appears
in your list of corpora in the “Load corpus” dialogue box. Simply
select it and choose “Load selected corpus” to open it for use in PCT.</li>
<li><strong>Save the corpus</strong>: The corpus itself will automatically be saved for use
on subsequent re-openings of PCT, without needing to be created again.
It can be exported as a .txt file and saved to a location of your choosing,
however, for use in spreadsheets or with other software. Once the corpus
has been created and loaded, simply go to “Corpus” / “Export corpus as
text file...” to save it using a system dialogue box.</li>

<p>3. The dialogue box for creating the corpus from text. Note that hyphens
and equal signs, which delimit morphological boundaries in the original,
have been ignored during the read-in. A space is entered into the word
delimiter box (not visible here). The period is selected as the transcription
delimiter. A feature system called gitksan2hayes_delimited, which maps the
delimited transcription system used in this example to the features given
in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#hayes2009" id="id9">[Hayes2009]</a>, has already been loaded into PCT (see <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#custom-feature"><em>Using a custom feature system</em></a>), and so is selected here.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="images/corpustranscribed.png"><img alt="images/corpustranscribed.png" class="align-center" src="images/corpustranscribed.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>Alternatively, the same corpus could be read in without being hand-delimited,
by constructing digraphs within the load corpus dialogue box, as follows:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="images/corpustranscribed_digraphs.png"><img alt="images/corpustranscribed_digraphs.png" class="align-center" src="images/corpustranscribed_digraphs.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>

<p>The corpus appears on the left, in the familiar columnar format. The
original text of the corpus appears at the right. Right-clicking on
a word in the corpus list gives you the option to “Find all tokens”
in the running text; these words will be highlighted. Similarly,
right-clicking a word in the running text gives you the option to
“Look up word,” which will highlight the word’s entry in the corpus list.</p>

<span id="spontaneous"></span><h2>Creating a spontaneous speech corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-a-spontaneous-speech-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Currently, only limited functionality is available for spontaneous speech
corpora, but this is a top priority for our next version. We provide an
interface for importing the TIMIT corpus
<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#timit" id="id10">[TIMIT]</a> or Buckeye corpus <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#buckeye" id="id11">[BUCKEYE]</a>, if you have independently
downloaded their corpus files. We currently provide preliminary
capabilities to create a corpus by reading in the text from a set of Praat TextGrids.</p>
<div class="section" id="working-with-your-own-textgrids">
<span id="textgrid"></span><h3>Working with your own TextGrids<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-your-own-textgrids" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Textgrids are automatically inspected for two kinds of tiers, words and
phones. Word tiers are ones that have some variation of &#8220;word&#8221; in them,
either plural or singular, and with any case (i.e. “Word,” “word,” and
“WORD” would all be detected). Phone tiers are ones that have a variant
of “phone,” “segment,” “transcription,” or “seg” in them. All Point Tiers
are ignored. All other interval tiers are included as word token attributes
(e.g.,  if there&#8217;s a tier called “Speech style” and an interval named
“casual” extends around the word token, the word token will have an
attribute for “Speech style” with the value “casual”). If there are
multiple speakers in a text gird, PCT expects word and phone tiers for
each speaker, such as “Speaker 1 – word” and “Speaker 2 - word.”</p>
<p>To create a spontaneous speech corpus from TextGrids, first ensure that
your TextGrids are all located in a single directory and have the above
properties. Click on “File” / “Load corpus...” / “Import spontaneous
speech corpus.” Select the directory where your TextGrids are located,
and choose “TextGrid” as the Corpus file set up option.</p>
<p>Here is an example of creating a corpus based on three .TextGrid files
from the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#csj" id="id12">[CSJ]</a>.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="images/importspontaneous.png"><img alt="images/importspontaneous.png" class="align-center" src="images/importspontaneous.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>Once the TextGrids have been processed, they appear in a window such as
the following. The regular corpus view is in the centre, with frequency
counts aggregated over the entire set of speakers / TextGrids. Note that
the transcription column may be blank for many words; this is because in
spontaneous speech, the citation / spelled words often have multiple
different transcribed forms in the corpus itself. To see these various
transcriptions, right-click on any word in the corpus and select “List
pronunciation variants.” A new dialogue box will pop up that shows the
individual pronunciation variants that occur in the corpus for that word,
along with their token frequencies.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="images/pronunciationvariant.png"><img alt="images/pronunciationvariant.png" class="align-center" src="images/pronunciationvariant.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p>In this example, each TextGrid is interpreted as belonging to a different
speaker, and these individual speakers are listed on the left. Clicking
on one of the speakers shows the transcript of that speaker’s speech in
a box on the right. This is not a corpus, but rather a sequential
listing of each word that was extracted, along with the transcription
and the timestamp of the beginning of that word in the TextGrid.
Right-clicking on a word in this list will give you the option to
look up the word’s summary entry in the corpus. Right-clicking a word
in the overall corpus will give you the option to “Find all tokens” of
that word in the transcriptions, where they will simply be highlighted.</p>

<span id="corpus-summary"></span><h2>Summary information about a corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-information-about-a-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Phonological CorpusTools allows you to get summary information about
your corpus at any time. To do so, go to “Corpus” / “Summary.”</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>General information</strong>: At the top of the “Corpus summary” dialogue box,
you’ll see the name of the corpus, the feature system currently being
used, and the number of words (entries) in the corpus.</li>
<li><strong>Inventory</strong>: Under the “Inventory” tab, there will generally be three
sections, “Consonants,” “Vowels,” and “Other.” (Note that this assumes
there is an interpretable feature system being used; if not, then all
elements in the inventory will be shown together.) Clicking the box
next to “Consonants” will show you the current set of consonants,
roughly arranged according to the IPA chart. Similarly, clicking the
box next to “Vowels” will show you the current set of consonants,
roughly arranged according to the IPA chart. Any other symbols
(e.g., the symbol for a word boundary, #) will be shown under “Other.”<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><strong>Segments</strong>: Clicking on any individual segment in the inventory will
display its type and token frequency in the corpus, both in terms
of the raw number of occurrences and the percentage of occurrences.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Columns</strong>: Under the “Columns” tab, you can get information about each
of the columns in your corpus (including any that you have added as
tiers or other columns; see <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#adding-editing-word-columns-tiers"><em>Adding, editing, and removing words, columns, and tiers</em></a>). The column labels are listed in
the drop-down menu. Selecting any column will show you its type
(spelling, tier, numeric, factor) and other available information.
Tier columns (based on transcriptions) will indicate which segments
are included in the tier. Numeric columns will indicate the range of
values contained.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you are finished examining the summary information, click “Done” to exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="subsetting-a-corpus">
<span id="corpus-subset"></span><h2>Subsetting a corpus<a class="headerlink" href="#subsetting-a-corpus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to subset a corpus, creating new corpora that have only
a portion of the original corpus. For example, one might want to create
a subset of a corpus that contains only words with a frequency greater
than 1, or contains only words of a particular part of speech or that
are spoken by a particular talker (if such information is available).
The new subsetted corpus will be saved and made available to open in
PCT as simply a new corpus.</p>
<p>To create a subset, click on “File” / “Generate a corpus subset” and follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Name</strong>: Enter the name for your new corpus. The default is to use the
name of the current corpus, followed by “_subset,” but a more informative
name (e.g., “Gitksan_nouns”) may be useful.</li>
<li><strong>Filters</strong>: Click on “Add filter” to add a filter that will be used to
subset the corpus. You can filter based on any numeric or factor tier
/ column that is part of your corpus. For a numeric column (e.g., frequency),
you can specify that you want words that have values that are equal to,
greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to,
or not equal to any given value. For a factor column (e.g. an abstract CV
skeleton tier), you can add as many or as few levels of the factor as you like.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple filters</strong>: After a filter has been created, you can choose to
“Add” it or “Add and create another” filter. The filters are
cumulative; i.e., having two filters will mean that the subset
corpus will contain items that pass through BOTH filters (rather
than, say, either filter, or having two subsets, one for each filter).</li>
<li><strong>Create subset</strong>: Once all filters have been selected, click on “Create
subset corpus.” You will be returned to your current corpus view,
but the subsetted corpus is available if you then go to “File” /
“Load corpus...” – it will automatically be added to your list of
available corpora. Note that the subset corpus will automatically
contain any additional tiers that were created in your original
corpus before subsetting.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="saving-and-exporting-a-corpus-or-feature-file">
<span id="corpus-save"></span><h2>Saving and exporting a corpus or feature file<a class="headerlink" href="#saving-and-exporting-a-corpus-or-feature-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If “Auto-save” is on (which is the default; see <a class="reference internal" href="#preferences"><em>Preferences</em></a>), most changes
to your corpus (adding words, tiers, etc.) will be saved automatically
and will be available the next time you load the corpus in PCT. Some
changes are not automatically saved (removing or editing word entries),
even if Auto-save is on, to prevent inadvertant loss of information.
If you have made changes that have not been automatically saved, and
then quit PCT, you will receive a warning message indicating that there
are unsaved changes. At that point, you may either choose “Don’t save”
(and therefore lose any such changes), “Save” (to save the changes in
its current state, to be used the next time it is loaded into PCT), or
“Cancel” (and return to the corpus view). It is also possible to export
the corpus as a text file (.txt), which can be opened in other software,
by selecting “File” / “Export corpus as text file” and entering the
file name and location and the column and transcription delimiters.
Similarly, the feature system can also be exported to a .txt file by
selecting “File” / “Export feature system as text file” and selecting
the file name and location and the column delimiter. See more about
the utility of doing so in <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#transcriptions-and-feature-systems"><em>Working with transcriptions and feature systems</em></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="preferences">
<span id="id13"></span><h3>Preferences<a class="headerlink" href="#preferences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are several preferences that can be set in PCT. These can be
selected by going to “Options” / “Preferences....” The following are available:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Storage</strong>:<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><strong>File location</strong>: By default, PCT will save corpus, feature, and
result files to your local “Documents” directory, which should
exist under the default settings on most computers. When saving
a particular output file, you can generally specify the particular
storage location as you are saving. However, it is also possible
to change the default storage location by changing the file path
in this dialogue box. You may enter the path name directly, or
select it from a system window by selecting “Choose directory...”.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-save</strong>: By default, PCT will automatically save changes to a
corpus (e.g., if you have updated a feature system, added a
tier, etc.). De-select this option if you prefer to manually
save such changes (PCT will prompt you before closing without
saving). Changes to word entries (removing or editing a word)
are NOT auto-saved and should be saved manually if you want them
to be saved; again, PCT will prompt you to save in these cases
before exiting. Once Auto-save is deselected, PCT will remember
that this is your preference for the next time you open the software -
it will not automatically get turned back on.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Display</strong>: By default, PCT will display three decimal places in on-screen
results tables (e.g., when calculating predictability of distribution or
string similarity, etc.). The number of displayed decimal places can
be globally changed here. Note that regardless of the number specified
here, PCT will save results to files using all of the decimal places
it has calculated.</li>
<li><strong>Processing</strong>: Some calculations consume rather a lot of computational
resources and can be made faster by using multiprocessing. To allow
PCT to use multiprocessing on multiple cores when that is possible,
select this option and indicate how many cores should be used (enter
0 to have PCT automatically use the ¾ of the number of cores available
on your machine).</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="help-and-warnings">
<span id="warnings"></span><h3>Help and warnings<a class="headerlink" href="#help-and-warnings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When using PCT, hovering over a dialogue box within a function will
automatically reveal quick ToolTips that give brief information about
the various aspects of the function. These can be turned on or off by
going to “Options” / “Show tooltips.”</p>
<p>PCT will also issue certain warnings if various parameters aren’t met.
It is possible to turn warning messages off by going to “Options” /
“Show warnings.”</p>

<span id="copy-paste"></span><h3>Copying and pasting<a class="headerlink" href="#copying-and-pasting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is possible to highlight the cells in any table view (a corpus, a
results window, etc.) and copy / paste a tab-delimited string version
of the data into another program (e.g., a spreadsheet or text editor)
using your standard copy &amp; paste keyboard commands (i.e., Ctrl-C and
Ctrl-V on a PC; Command-C and Command-V on a Mac).</p>
