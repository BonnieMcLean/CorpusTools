<p>Phonotactic probability refers to the likelihood of a given set of segments
occurring in a given order for a given corpus of transcriptions.  For instance,
<em>blick</em> is a phonotactically probable nonword in English, but <em>bnick</em> is
phonotactically improbable.  Words as well as nonwords can be assessed for
their phonotactic probability, and this measure has been used in behavioural
research (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#vitevitch1999" id="id2">[Vitevitch1999]</a> and others). In particular, the phonotactic
probability of words has been correlated with their ability to be segmented,
acquired, processed, and produced; see especially the discussion in <a class="reference internal" href="references.html#vitevitch2004" id="id3">[Vitevitch2004]</a>
for extensive references.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="method-of-calculation">
<span id="method-phonotactic-probability"></span><h2>Method of calculation<a class="headerlink" href="#method-of-calculation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One method for computing the phonotactic probability uses average unigram
or bigram positional probabilities across a word (<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#vitevitch2004" id="id4">[Vitevitch2004]</a>;
their online calculator for this function is available <a class="reference external" href="http://www.people.ku.edu/~mvitevit/PhonoProbHome.html">here</a>).
For a word like <em>blick</em> in English, the unigram average would include the
probability of /b/ occurring in the first position of a word, the
probability of /l/ in the second position, the probability of /ɪ/
occuring in the third position, and the probability of /k/ occurring
in the fourth position of a word.  Each positional probability is
calculated by summing the log token frequency of words containing that
segment in that position divided by the sum of the log token frequency
of all words that have that position in their transcription.  The bigram
average is calculated in an equivalent way, except that sequences of two
segments and their positions are used instead of single segments.  So for
<em>blick</em> that would be /bl/, /lɪ/, /ɪk/ as the included poisitional probabilities.
As with all n-gram based approaches, bigrams are preferable to unigrams.
In the example of <em>blick</em> versus <em>bnick</em>, unigrams wouldn&#8217;t likely capture
the intuitive difference in phonotactic probability, since the probability
of /n/ and /l/ in the second position isn&#8217;t necessarily radically different.
Using bigrams, however, would capture that the probability of /bl/ versus /bn/
in the first position is radically different.</p>
<p>There are other ways of calculating phonotactic probability that don&#8217;t
have the strict left-to-right positional assumptions that the Vitevitch
&amp; Luce algorithm has, such as the constraint-based method in BLICK by
Bruce Hayes (Windows executable available <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/BLICK/">here</a>, Python package
available <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-BLICK/0.2.12">here</a>
with source code available at &lt;<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mmcauliffe/python-BLICK/">https://github.com/mmcauliffe/python-BLICK/</a>&gt;_).
However, such algorithms require training on a specific language, and
the constraints are not computed from transcribed corpora in as
straightforward a manner as the probabilities used in the Vitevitch &amp;
Luce algorithm. Therefore, PCT currently supports only the Vitevitch &amp;
Luce style algorithm.</p>

<span id="phonotactic-probability-gui"></span><h2>Implementing the phonotactic probability function in the GUI<a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-the-phonotactic-probability-function-in-the-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To start the analysis, click on “Analysis” / “Calculate phonotactic probability...”
in the main menu, and then follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Phonotactic probability algorithm</strong>: Currently the only offered algorithm
is the Vitevitch &amp; Luce algorithm, described above.</li>
<li><strong>Query type</strong>: Phonotactic probability can be calculated for one of three
types of inputs:<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><strong>One word</strong>: The phonotactic probability of a single word can be calculated
by entering that word’s orthographic representation in the query box.</li>
<li><strong>One word/nonword not in the corpus</strong>: The phonotactic probability can
be calculated on a word that is not itself in the corpus, but using
the probabilities derived from the corpus. These words are distinct
from the corpus and won&#8217;t be added to it, nor will their creation
affect any future calculations. See <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#add-word"><em>Adding a word</em></a> for information on how
to more permanently add a new word to the corpus. Words can be
created through the dialogue opened by pressing the button:<ol class="lowerroman">
<li><strong>Spelling</strong>: Enter the spelling for your new word / nonword using
the regular input keyboard on your computer. The spelling is
how the word will be referenced in the results table, but won’t
affect the calculation of phonotactic probability.</li>
<li><strong>Transcription</strong>: To add in the phonetic transcription of the new
word, it is best to use the provided inventory. While it is
possible to type directly in to the transcription box, using
the provided inventory will ensure that all characters are
understood by PCT to correspond to existing characters in the
corpus (with their concomitant featural interpretation). Click
on “Show inventory” and then choose to show “Consonants,” “Vowels,”
and/or other. (If there is no featural interpretation of your
inventory, you will simply see a list of all the available
segments, but they will not be classifed by major category.)
Clicking on the individual segments will add them to the
transcription. The selections will remain even when the
sub-inventories are hidden; we allow for showing / hiding
the inventories to ensure that all relevant buttons on the
dialogue box are available, even on small computer screens.
Note that you do NOT need to include word boundaries at the
beginning and end of the word, even when the boundary symbol
is included as a member of the inventory; these will be assumed
automatically by PCT.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency</strong>: This can be left at the default. Note that entering
a value will NOT affect the calculation; there is no particular
need to enter anything here (it is an artifact of using the same
dialogue box here as in the “Add Word” function described in <a class="reference internal" href="transcriptions_and_feature_systems.html#add-word"><em>Adding a word</em></a>).</li>
<li><strong>Create word</strong>: To finish and return to the “Phonotactic probability”
dialogue box, click on “Create word.”</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>List of words</strong>: If there is a specific list of words for which
phonotactic probability is to be calculated (e.g., the stimuli list
for an experiment), that list can be saved as a .txt file with one
word per line and uploaded into PCT for analysis.  If words in the
list are not in the corpus, you can still calculate their phonotactic
probability by entering in the spelling of the word and the transcription
of the word in a single line delimited by a tab. The transcription
should be delimited by periods.</li>
<li><strong>Whole corpus</strong>: Alternatively, the phonotactic probability for every
current word in the corpus can be calculated. The phonotactic
probability of each word will be added to the corpus itself, as
a separate column; in the “query” box, simply enter the name of
that column (the default is “Phonotactic probability”).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Tier</strong>: Phonotactic probability can be calculated from transcription
tiers in a corpus (e.g., transcription or tiers that represent subsets
of entries, such as a vowel or consonant tier).</li>
<li><strong>Type vs. token frequency</strong>: Specify whether phonotactic probabilities
should be based on word type frequency or token frequency.  The
original Vitevitch &amp; Luce algorithm uses token frequency. Token frequency
will use the log frequency when calculating probabilities.</li>
<li><strong>Probability type</strong>: Specify whether to use biphone positional
probabilities or single segment positional probabilities.  Defaults to biphone.</li>
<li><strong>Results</strong>: Once all options have been selected, click “Calculate
phonotactic probability.” If this is not the first calculation, and
you want to add the results to a pre-existing results table, select
the choice that says “add to current results table.” Otherwise, select
“start new results table.” A dialogue box will open, showing a table of
the results, including the word, its phonotactic probability, the
transcription tier from which phonotactic probability was calculated,
whether type or token frequency was used, whether the algorithm used
unigram or bigram probabilities, and the phonotactic probability algorithm
that was used. If the phonotactic probability for all words in the corpus
is being calculated, simply click on the “start new results table” option,
and you will be returned to your corpus, where a new column has been added
automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Saving results</strong>: The results tables can each be saved to tab-delimited .txt
files by selecting “Save to file” at the bottom of the window. If all
phonotactic probabilities are calculated for a corpus, the corpus
itself can be saved by going to “File” / “Export corpus as text file,”
from where it can be reloaded into PCT for use in future sessions with
the phonotactic probabilities included.</li>

<p>To return to the function dialogue box with your most recently used
selections, click on “Reopen function dialog.” Otherwise, the results
table can be closed and you will be returned to your corpus view.</p>
